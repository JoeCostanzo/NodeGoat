# Joe's NodeGoat
My attempt to effectively address the OWASP Top 10 security risks applied to a web application developed using Node.js.

## Learn More
This project references the OWASP Top 10 for Node.js web applications
[Find out more at the OWASP website](https://www.owasp.org)

### Know the vulnerabilities!
[Tutorial Guide](http://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/tutorial) explaining how each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities can manifest in Node.js web apps and how to prevent it.

### See the results!
[My online instance of the 'Vulnerable Node.js App' (with security enhancements)](http://joesnodegoat.herokuapp.com/) 

## This repo
This repo is a demonstration of my refactoring and web app security skills.

Herein I have made the 'vulnerable web app' more secure and hardened (with added enhancements around syntax updates, following more canonical / modern coding standards, style, and patterns).

It uses standard NodeJS / NPM patterns to run, and is deployed at the link above using Heroku.
